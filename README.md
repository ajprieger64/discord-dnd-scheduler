# discord-dnd-scheduler
A bot to schedule DnD games on private Discord servers

This is a very simple project designed for me and my friends to ease scheduling of Dungeons and Dragons sessions.

If you're here from the internet, welcome! Feel free to use, fork, or copy any or all of this project, pursuant to the license. You can also drop a feature request if you'd like, although I'm maintaining this project principally for myself and make no guarantee about responding or implementing.
